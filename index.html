        <h3 class="chapter-title">Self-Accepted</h3>
        
        <p class="content">I grew up in a double-wide trailer in Ellendale, Delaware. The outside looked like a junkyard—patchy grass, nowhere to park, rust in the air.</p>
        
        <p class="content">But inside? It was a house lined with Black brilliance. Bookshelves sagging under the weight of Baldwin and bell hooks, Zora and Assata. Big books, small books, red books, blue books. It looked like we were preparing for a war, and the books were our weapons.</p>
        
        <p class="content">Denise—mother, my first teacher—kept us surrounded by literature. Reading wasn't optional. It wasn't escape. <span class="emphasis">It was inheritance.</span></p>
        
        <p class="content">That's why that old, tired saying never made sense to me:</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>"If you ever wanted to hide something from a nigger, put it in a book."</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p><em>To me, that meant something was being hidden.</em></p>
            <p>But if they <em>really</em> wanted to hide it,<br>
            why put it somewhere so <strong>public</strong>?<br>
            Made no sense—<br>
            <em>unless they never expected us to read it.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p><em>Like the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights.</em><br>
            <strong>Warm, sleepy, monotone, nasally voice</strong> teaching<br>
            Foundational knowledge we all should know<br>
            <em>But fell asleep during the class that taught it.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">So, my child-brain took it as a challenge:</p>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p><em>"Cool. I'll just read every book in the library."</em></p>
            <p><strong>Matilda but Black.</strong><br>
            Same <em>fluorescent lights</em> buzzed,<br>
            <em>Cheap sneakers</em> that squeaked on <em>linoleum</em><br>
            but <strong>no Ms. Honey.</strong><br>
            Just me, <em>dusty books</em>, and a <strong>dare</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p><em>I thought I had outsmarted the oh-so-powerful white man.</em><br>
            <strong>White people are weird.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">So, I read.<br>
        Consuming what they called <strong>knowledge</strong><br>
        and choking on<br>
        the <em>limits in every line.</em></p>
        
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Nat Turner Play</h3>
        
        <p class="content">In third grade, I wrote a play about Harriet Tubman leading people to freedom. It won the local history competition.</p>
        
        <p class="content">In fifth grade, I did it again—a play about Nat Turner's rebellion. And I won again, for writing a story about a deadly slave rebellion. Looking back... wild.</p>
        
        <p class="content">A whole-ass Nat Turner rebellion play? In a mostly white school?</p>
        
        <p class="content">The well-meaning liberals ate it up like Sunday dinner. They never asked about the irony.</p>
        
        <p class="content">Or maybe they did. Either way, I didn't flinch.</p>
        
        <h3 class="chapter-title">Curated Knowledge</h3>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p>From first through twelfth grade, <em>I devoured every book I could.</em><br>
            I read more than anyone in school history.<br>
            My name stayed on a printout in the library.<br>
            At a school full of white doctor children—<br>
            the little Black girl had read the <em>most books.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content"><em>I liked being that girl, the girl who reads</em></p>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p>My mom supported my dream of being a reader, a thinker.<br>
            But she made one decision that shaped me forever:<br>
            <strong>She curated my knowledge.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">Nearly every book I read was by someone Black.<br>
        That wasn't an accident.<br>
        Dr. Seuss was allowed.<br>
        Oh, and <em>A Child Called It.</em><br>
        My 8th grade teacher said I might like it.</p>
        
        <p class="content"><em>I wonder why she thought that.</em></p>
        
        <p class="content">Outside of Seuss and that one book, every author was Black.<br>
        Picture books. Novels. All of it.<br>
        It wasn't until <em>Harry Potter</em> dropped—summer before 9th grade—<br>
        that I stepped outside that curated world.</p>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p>Like the boy in <em>It</em>, and like Harry,<br>
            always hearing the laughing<br>
            but never doing the laughing—<br>
            <em>I knew what it meant to wait for better days.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">But I wasn't waiting for magic.<br>
        Just... better.<br>
        Falling in a fit of giggles<br>
        with a bestie.</p>
        
        <p class="content">Still, I hadn't chosen a single book by a non-Black author.<br>
        No Judy Blume. No Hardy Boys. No Roald Dahl.<br>
        I didn't learn about Shakespeare, the Greeks, or the Romans until college.</p>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p>Every time the world tried to enforce whiteness on me,<br>
            <strong>my mother countered it with Blackness.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">I once came home from school, after learning we all came from somewhere—<br>
        and that the only true Americans were the Natives.<br>
        I told my mom, and I asked her what I was mixed with.</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>With a slight raise of the eyebrow, and an amused <em>hmph</em>, she answered:<br>
            <strong>"Black and Blacker. If you're mixed, it's with Black and Blacker."</strong><br>
            "Yea but my real dad..."<br>
            <strong>"Joe is your real dad."</strong><br>
            "But my <em>real</em> dad isn't Black."<br>
            <strong>"Oh yea? Then what the hell is he?"</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">I shrugged.<br>
        He wasn't the same color as Denise and me.</p>
        
        <p class="content">She then told me to ask my teacher what <em>Black</em> was mixed with.<br>
        <strong>"See if she'll tell you the truth,"</strong> she muttered.</p>
        
        <p class="content">The people in my coloring books were always brown.</p>
        
        <div class="poetry">
            <p>She didn't just tell me I was Black.<br>
            <strong>She made sure I knew it meant power.</strong></p>
